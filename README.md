Learning how to use react with APIs.

## Setup
- create react-app
- create StockInfo.js component
- add state, and get that state to render
- `yarn add axios` to install axios: Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js 
- create `api` folder within `src` and add a file for grabbing the API data - in this case, from IEX: `iex.js`
- follow axios documentation to setup get requests
- use `componentDidMount()` to get the data to render when loaded

## Add user input field
1. Get the input field to render
2. Add the input data to state
3. Get the state to respond to user interaction
